# Traktor Live v3

[![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/tag/dotherightthing/traktor-live-v3)](https://github.com/dotherightthing/traktor-live-v3/releases) [![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/dotherightthing/traktor-live-v3.svg)](https://github.com/dotherightthing/traktor-live-v3/issues)

Traktor Pro mix template using multiple MIDI controllers. This is a 'fork' of <https://github.com/dotherightthing/traktor-live-v2/> and changes the supported MIDI controllers.

Includes Ableton Live starter file.

I've documented this for my own benefit, but please help yourself to any part you find useful.

## Purpose

The purpose of this setup is to replace Traktor Pro’s Remix Decks and Loop Recorder with Ableton Live.

### Replace Traktor Pro’s Remix Decks

Traktor Pro’s Remix Decks mostly work fine when resampling directly from a deck.

However when keylock pitching is used, the recorded pitch often does not match the source deck.

### Replace Traktor Pro’s Loop Recorder

To capture global FX like reverb and gating, Traktor Pro’s Loop Recorder must be used.

The Loop Recorder is problematic because it records loops slightly too long. Samples glitch on repeat and drift out of sync with the source material.

### 1. Physical Sound Card

#### MacBook Pro

This setup is for the Traktor Kontrol Z1. Mixing is only done on headphones, so the master mix goes to both Left and Right channels (for monitoring and recording with Audio Hijack) and cueing goes to the Right channel (this is not recorded). This is a variation on the [split cue](https://www.digitaldjtips.com/2019/05/dj-tips-tricks-what-split-cue-is-why-you-may-want-to-use-it/) approach.

---

### 2. Virtual Sound Card

#### Rogue Amoeba Loopback

* Product: <https://rogueamoeba.com/loopback/>
* Version: 2

Loopback allows additional stereo pairs to be added to an existing sound card. These pairs can then be used for internal routing via input and output settings in Traktor Pro and Ableton Live.

Some web tutorials use Jack Audio instead. I prefer Loopback’s routing UI.

In order to be able to choose which Traktor Pro deck to sample from, both decks are routed to Ableton Live.

##### Ableton Live MIDI setup (Traktor)

<img src="ableton-live/screenshots/midi.png" alt="Screenshot of Ableton Live's MIDI configuration" width="500">

The default ClyphX Pro 'controller' is primarily used to sync MIDI clock between Traktor Pro and Ableton Live (MIDI input).

Additionally, ClyphX Pro is used to send scripted MIDI messages to Traktor Pro (MIDI output). When this is done, channel `16` is used to make it clear that Traktor Pro is being targetted. See also the M4L Device on the master channel.

Note: `MIDI Clock Sync Delay` was initially set using Traktor Pro's internal mixer, with *Cue out* used to sync Traktor Pro and Ableton Live's metronomes. Ableton Live now functions as the external mixer and syncing does not appear to be an issue anymore.

#### Midi Fighter Twister

* Product: <https://store.djtechtools.com/products/midi-fighter-twister>

##### Ableton Live MIDI setup

* Control Surface: `ClyphX Pro XTA`, `ClyphX Pro XTB`, `ClyphX Pro XTC`
* Input: `Midi Fighter Twister`, `Midi Fighter Twister #1`, `Midi Fighter Twister #2` (each in any slot, see [#6](https://github.com/dotherightthing/traktor-live-v3/issues/6))
  * Track: `Off`
  * Sync: `Off`
  * Remote: `On`
* Output: `Midi Fighter Twister`, `Midi Fighter Twister #1`, `Midi Fighter Twister #2` (each in any slot, see [#6](https://github.com/dotherightthing/traktor-live-v3/issues/6))
  * Track: `Off`
  * Sync: `Off`
  * Remote: `On`

The project uses three MFTs (Midi Fighter Twisters), but the Midi Fighter Utility only supports one. Therefore the four available banks of stock CCs are split between the MFTs:

* MFT A (Sample 1 and Sample 2): Bank 1
* MFT B (Sample 3 and Sample 4): Bank 2
* MFT C (Resample and Utilities): Bank 3

Each MFT does identify itself uniquely (`Midi Fighter Twister`, `Midi Fighter Twister #1`, `Midi Fighter Twister #2`) but these identities are not locked to the physical hardware and can shift and change. Therefore the mappings for each MFT are shared with every MFT - i.e. the XTA/XTB/XTC folders are clones.

At the launch of the project, each MFT should be switched to Bank 1, 2 or 3. This should happen automatically via the `STARTUP_ACTIONS`, or press one of the 3 buttons on each MFT's side.

When configured to send out MIDI messages, each MFT uses the following;

* Channel 1 = encoder / encoder LEDs
* Channel 2 = button / RGB indicator
* Channel 4 = system: side buttons incl bank switching
* Channel 5 = 'Shift Encoder Hold' / encoder press and turn (note: Factory Reset required - see <https://forum.djtechtools.com/showthread.php?t=95122> and <https://forum.djtechtools.com/showthread.php?t=96642>)

###### VU Meters

These use the *midiAudioToCC* VST, which is part of the *PIZ MIDI plugins* package by [Paul Cecchetti](https://www.paulcecchettimusic.com).

In order to display a VU Meter on a Midi Fighter encoder:

1. Create an Audio track which takes input from one of the sampler tracks
2. Put an instance of *midiAudioToCC* on this Audio track.
3. MIDI map the Midi Fighter encoder to the Envelope L control (or use ClyphX Pro's Encoder Bindings to do so)
4. Toggle on Monitor for this track
5. Mute this track
6. The signal level will display when the sampler track is not muted

Default settings are applied on `$RESET$`. Live's *Save as Default Configuration* function does not appear to work properly with this device.

### 6. Controller Overlay

The worst part about customising generic MIDI controllers is remembering what everything does.

* Sticky labels are the defacto solution, but these become incorrect when you switch to different software.
* An iPad provides a dynamic labelled interface which liberates the user from the laptop screen, but requires monitoring of finger position on the smooth touchscreen.
* Some physical overlays can also be purchased online, but these often require labelling, and there are environmental costs in shipping them.

Custom physical overlays solve these labelling issues. They look nice, can be switched out quickly, and are great for protoyping.

The process to generate an overlay is as follows:

#### Process

##### Create a cut file

Create a cut file by extracting SVG designs from hardware manuals (below), or by creating an SVG from scratch using Inkscape and a ruler.

1. Create a baseplate to match the top of your controller
2. Create and place shapes for the various faders, knobs, encoders and switches (with end caps removed)
3. Group these shapes
4. Duplicate the baseplate and the shapes group and hide the originals so you can edit them later as required
5. Select the original shapes group, then select *Path > Combine*
6. Remove the shapes from the baseplate by selecting the combined shape and the baseplate, then selecting *Path > Difference*

###### Generate an SVG from a PDF hardware manual (optional)

1. File > Import
    1. Select page
    2. Internal import
    3. Uncheck 'replace fonts & embed images'
    4. Precision: 2.0 (default)
2. Fix dimensions
    1. Select objects on page
    2. `COMMAND + G` to group
    3. Transform > Scale
    4. Set width and height to the dimensions in the owner manual
    5. Scale proportionally
3. Outline the physical controls
    1. View > Display mode > Outline
    2. Double-click parts to edit them directly
    3. Use `+`/`-` to zoom in/out
    4. Click near letters, click inside shapes
    5. Use `delete` to delete lines that won't be cut
    6. Use node editing tools to ensure that cut paths are unbroken
4. Edit objects
    1. Object > Objects...
    2. Maximise the panel (close other panels)
    3. Click 3D rectangle layer icon to select that object
    4. Select all g... objects and ungroup them
    5. Delete all g... layers (empty groups)
    6. Optimise one of each individual control (e.g. channel strip)
    7. Group each individual control
    8. Use guides to position copies of these in their original positions
5. Export SVG

##### Create a print file

Create a separate print file by duplicating the cut file and adding additional layout to match that created by Cricut Design Space's Print Then Cut process.

This mitigates unresolved [text degradation caused by Cricut Design Space at print time](https://github.com/dotherightthing/traktor-live-v3/issues/4), otherwise text labels could be added directly to the cut file.

The dimensions below are taken from a PDF generated by Print Then Cut (System Dialog > Print > PDF).

1. Create an A4 file in Inkscape (209.903mm x 296.686mm)
2. Create a box and give it a black stroke of 1.5mm
3. Resize the box so that it is 7mm larger than your baseplate on all sides, and position it in the same way
4. Check that the stroke is still 1.5mm and the gap is still 7mm
5. Group the box and baseplate
6. Position the group at 11.994mm from the top and left of the canvas
7. Add one or more groups of text labels to describe the various controls and modes of operation.
8. Print the A4 page using Cricut Design Space with the System Dialog option, and the laser printer's Graphics Quality > Text option (I chose a Brother laser printer for sharper text)

##### Cut the cut file

1. Load the cut file into Cricut Design Space
2. Change the dimensions to match Inkscape
3. Set position to 0, 0
4. Hide any layers/groups which were previously hidden in Inkscape (SVG text layers are automatically removed)
5. Select Flatten
6. Select Make It > Continue
7. For Print, select I've Already Printed
8. Affix the printout to a Cricut cutting mat
9. Set Base Material
10. Load mat and press Go
11. Optionally repeat with a sheet of plastic to create a second protective layer
12. Peel the overlay off the cutting mat so the cut sections separate

Note: Cricut Maker does have a pen attachment, but I use this sparingly as 'pen' lines for text labels add complexity to the file and dramatically increase loading times.

##### Apply overlay

1. Remove any blocking controls (e.g. fader handles) from the controller
2. Slide the overlay over the top of the controller
3. Reattach any blocking controls onto the controller

### 7. Mix Recorder

#### Rogue Amoeba Audio Hijack

* Product: <https://rogueamoeba.com/audiohijack/>
* Version: 3

While Ableton Live can be used to record the evolving mix and any automation, the playback head jumps to the beginning of the arrangement timeline when Traktor Pro is requested to send a Master Clock Sync message to Ableton Live.

This runs the risk of overwriting existing audio later in the mix.

One solution is to use an external recording app, however free macOS apps provide limited control over what can be recorded.

For example, Quicktime can't distinguish between the individual channels used by the Loopback device, while [Audacity can only record all of them at once](https://forum.audacityteam.org/viewtopic.php?t=63424).

Audio Hijack offers two alternatives to this:

1. record directly from an application (e.g. Ableton Live)
2. record from specific virtual output channels (e.g. channels 1+2 of a Loopback device)

In addition Audio Hijack makes it clear *when* it is recording, by optionally displaying level meters in the [macOS menu bar](https://support.apple.com/en-nz/guide/mac-help/mchlp1446/10.15/mac/10.15).

##### Project file

### 9. Further Reading

#### FAQs

##### Why can't I hear recording clips in Ableton Live?

Press the sync button to sync playback with Traktor Pro.

##### Why can't I hear FX trails after crossfading

Ensure that both 'A' and 'B' crossfader assigns are unchecked on both FX channels.

##### Why can't I hear any sound, or only briefly before it cuts out?

Toggle the On-Off switch in the Monitor column (Z1 device) of Loopback.
